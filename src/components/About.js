      <p className="about">
        Founded in 2017 as a club sport under the original name “M Barbell,” our team has grown into a dynamic and inclusive community known today for its spirit and achievements, including both graduate and undergraduate students who share a passion for weightlifting and strive to push their limits every day. Our hard work has led us to significant successes on both national and international stages, placing in prestigious competitions and representing our club in international events. The commitment of our athletes to excellence and their unwavering support for each other make our team a vibrant part of the University of Michigan’s athletic community.

      <p className="about">
        Though familiarity with Olympic lifts is preferred, we view each athlete holistically. Our roster ranges from 20 to 35 dedicated athletes with varying skill levels. We welcome those eager to learn and improve, regardless of prior experience. Olympic weightlifting, consisting of the snatch and clean & jerk, is one of the oldest athletic endeavors, included in the Olympic Games since 1896. In the U.S., it is a relatively small sport, with collegiate weightlifting representing an even smaller fraction. However, at Michigan, we are the leaders and the best.

      <p className="about">
        Michigan Weightlifting is the first Olympic weightlifting club sport in the Big 10 and one of a handful in the nation. Our goal is to contribute to the growth of the sport at the university level, offering a club for athletes to learn Olympic weightlifting. We started with a few students and big dreams. Within two years, we secured legendary coach Robert Morris, taught over 30 athletes, competed in 7 local meets, and found a home at Wolverine Strength & Conditioning. In September 2019, Michigan Weightlifting gained university sponsorship. Our goal is to send as many athletes as possible to the National University Championships.
